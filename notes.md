## Agent based system

# Static vs. Dynamic scheduling
1) Compare EDLS with and without Agent based system
2) Compare TEDLS with and without Agent based system

# Plots with EDLS and TEDLS
1) 25 DAG  (3 processors) for explanantion
2) 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 DAG with (5 processors) Average energy vs. DAG size
